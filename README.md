# Interaction Programing - Lab 2

=================================================

This branch contains new tests for lab 2. For more details on this assignment, follow the instructions on the [course website](https://www.kth.se/social/course/DH2642).

## Tests

Open `test.html` in the browser and tests should run automatically.

## Config

The API calls requires an API key, which is placed in a `config.js` file. Therefore you need to create such a file and place it at the root. Then add the content below to your config file, and replace the dummy string with your API-key:

```js
const config = {
  SECRET_API_KEY: "your-api-key-goes-here"
};
```
